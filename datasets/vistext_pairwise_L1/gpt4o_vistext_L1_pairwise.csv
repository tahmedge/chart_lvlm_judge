This increase is due to several factors , including the growing importance of R & D in the global economy , the increasing availability of funding for R & D in Portugal , and the government 's commitment to increasing R & D spending . The chart also shows that the GERD in Portugal is still below the European Union average , which was 2.03 % in 2017 . This suggests that Portugal has the potential to increase its R & D spending further and become a more competitive player in the global economy .","```json
