Model A Generated Answer: The chart presents a visual representation of how people perceive the historical significance of various U.S. presidents . The y-axis shows the `` Below average '' score , which indicates the degree to which each president is expected to be remembered in a negative light . The presidents are listed in chronological order from left to right , with some presidents , such as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton , having relatively higher `` Below average '' scores , suggesting they may be viewed more negatively in the eyes of the respondents . Conversely , presidents like Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon have lower `` Below average '' scores , implying a more positive historical perception . The chart provides an interesting snapshot of public opinion regarding the legacy of U.S. presidents .

Gold Reference Answer: Here a is a line chart labeled Percentage of people who use a computer every day in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2003 to 2017 . Percentage of respondents is defined with a linear scale with a minimum of 0.0 and a maximum of 0.8 along the y-axis . A linear scale from 2004 to 2016 can be seen along the x-axis , marked Response .
Model A Generated Answer: The chart depicts the relationship between response and percentage of respondents over time , showing an upward trend from 2004 to 2016 . The line graph illustrates the gradual increase in the percentage of respondents , reaching a peak around 2014 before stabilizing at a slightly lower level in the subsequent years . The data points and the overall shape of the curve suggest a consistent growth pattern in the response metric being measured , though the specific details of the variable are not explicitly stated in the image .
Model B Generated Answer: The chart shows the percentage of respondents who chose each response option over time . The response options are `` A '' , `` B '' , `` C '' , and `` D '' . The chart shows that the percentage of respondents who chose option `` A '' and option `` D '' both increased over time , while the percentage of respondents who chose option `` B '' decreased over time . The percentage of respondents who chose option `` C '' remained relatively stable .","{  ""Model"": ""Model A"",  ""Explanation"": ""Model A provides a more accurate and relevant description of the chart. It correctly identifies the chart as a line graph showing the relationship between response and percentage of respondents over time, and it accurately describes the upward trend from 2004 to 2016. Model B, on the other hand, incorrectly describes the chart as showing the percentage of respondents who chose different response options (A, B, C, D), which is not depicted in the chart. Therefore, Model A is more concise, factually correct, and relevant to the chart.""}",5913,With Reference,multi-dimensional

Ideally, a better quality caption should be concise, factually correct, and relevant to the chart, while also providing high level informative insights of the chart.

Please provide your response in JSON format with the following keys: (i) Model, (ii) Explanation.

Here, the output value for the 'model' key is the respective model that is better, could be either 'Model A' or 'Model B', or 'Tie' if both models are equally good.

The value for the ""Explanation"" key will contain the reason behind your preference.

You should only provide the response in the required JSON format without any additional text such that I can correctly parse the result from your JSON formatted response.

In the following, you are first provided with the gold reference caption. Afterwards, you are given the model generated captions. You are also provided with the chart image which was used as the context for the chart captioning task.

Model A Generated Answer: The chart depicts the wine production in the United States and California from 2006 to 2017 , measured in million gallons . The data shows a general upward trend over the years , with some fluctuations . The production peaked in 2014 at around 800 million gallons and then declined slightly in the following years . The chart does not provide any additional context or analysis beyond the raw data presented .
Model B Generated Answer: The chart shows the wine production in the United States and California from 2006 to 2017 . The wine production in the United States increased from 580 million gallons in 2006 to 780 million gallons in 2017 . The wine production in California increased from 500 million gallons in 2006 to 720 million gallons in 2017 .","{  ""Model"": ""Tie"",  ""Explanation"": ""Both Model A and Model B provide relevant and factually correct information about the chart. Model A gives a detailed description of the trends in wine production, including the peak year and subsequent decline, which adds informative insights. Model B provides specific data points for both the United States and California, which is also informative. Both models are concise and relevant, making them equally good in this context.""}",6696,With Reference,multi-dimensional

Gold Reference Answer: Zimbabwe : Urbanization from 2009 to 2019 is a area graph . On the y-axis , Share of urban population in total population is shown . A linear scale with a minimum of 2010 and a maximum of 2018 can be found along the x-axis , labeled Response .
Model A Generated Answer: The chart depicts the urbanization trend in Zimbabwe from 2009 to 2019 , as represented by the `` Share of urban population in total population '' metric . The data is presented in a line graph format , with the years 2010 , 2012 , 2014 , 2016 , and 2018 shown on the x-axis , and the share of urban population on the y-axis . The chart shows a relatively stable and consistent urbanization rate in Zimbabwe during this period , with the share of urban population remaining around 0.33 throughout the timeframe .
Model B Generated Answer: Zimbabwe 's urbanization rate increased from 32.5 % in 2009 to 34.2 % in 2019 . The rate of increase was slowest between 2014 and 2018 .","{  ""Model"": ""Model A"",  ""Explanation"": ""Model A provides a more comprehensive and accurate description of the chart. It correctly identifies the chart type as a line graph and accurately describes the axes, including the specific years shown on the x-axis and the metric on the y-axis. Additionally, Model A mentions the stability of the urbanization rate, which is relevant to the data presented. In contrast, Model B focuses on specific percentages and rates of increase without providing a detailed description of the chart  s construction or the overall trend, making it less informative and relevant.""}",5328,With Reference,multi-dimensional
