This increase is likely due to a number of factors . One factor that has been linked to an increased risk of preterm birth is the rising rate of obesity among women of childbearing age . Another factor that may be contributing to the increase in preterm births is the increasing use of fertility treatments .","{  ""Model"": ""Model A"",  ""Explanation"": ""Model A provides a more accurate and detailed description of the chart. It correctly identifies the general trend of preterm births increasing from 1990 to 2018, with specific percentages mentioned for key years (1990, 2006, and 2018). It also notes the peak in 2006 and the slight decline since then, which aligns with the data shown in the chart.

"Suppose, you are an human evaluator.
You are given the captions generated by two different models in the chart captioning task. Now, your task is to determine which model is better by considering the relevancy, conciseness, informativeness, and factual correctness of the model generated caption. Ideally, a better quality caption should be concise, factually correct, and relevant to the chart, while also providing high level informative insights of the chart.

Please provide your response in JSON format with the following keys: (i) Model, (ii) Explanation.

Here, the output value for the 'model' key is the respective model that is better, could be either 'Model A' or 'Model B', or 'Tie' if both models are equally good.

The value for the ""Explanation"" key will contain the reason behind your preference.

You should only provide the response in the required JSON format without any additional text such that I can correctly parse the result from your JSON formatted response.

In the following, you are provided with the model generated captions. You are also provided with the chart image which was used as the context for the chart captioning task.
